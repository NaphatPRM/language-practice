# language-practice

This repository implements the language practice similar to Wanikuni in Japanese with much less features (no time spacing). 
The website will includes two main parts:
1. The Vocabulary creation: For this part, the user will enter the words in the specific language (such as Kanji in Japanese) along with the meaning of the word. If that word requires both the meaning and the prononciation.
2. The practice section: Based on the vocabulary you register, this part will randomize the word you input for you to practice.
